# Low Level Design (LLD) Readme

## 1. Component Level Design Process

The Component Level Design (CLD) process involves breaking down the system into smaller components or modules, each responsible for specific functionality. This stage bridges the gap between architectural design and detailed implementation.

### Key Steps in Component Level Design:

- **Identifying Components**: Analyzing the system requirements to determine distinct functional units.
  
- **Defining Interfaces**: Specifying how components interact with each other through well-defined interfaces.
  
- **Assigning Responsibilities**: Allocating specific tasks and functionalities to each component.
  
- **Detailing Data Structures**: Designing data structures that components will utilize.
  
- **Considering Constraints**: Addressing performance, security, and other non-functional requirements.

## 2. Provides Internal Logic of Software Being Developed

LLD provides a detailed blueprint of how each component functions internally. It specifies the algorithms, data structures, and modules required for implementation.

### Internal Logic Elements:

- **Algorithms**: Detailed steps and procedures used to achieve specific tasks within each component.
  
- **Data Structures**: Definitions of data organization and manipulation methods.
  
- **Module Interactions**: How different modules within a component communicate and collaborate.
  
- **Error Handling**: Strategies for managing exceptions and errors within the component.

## 3. Defines the Class Diagram

A Class Diagram is a visual representation of the structure and relationships of classes in the system.

### Elements of a Class Diagram:

- **Classes**: Representing entities with attributes and methods.
  
- **Attributes**: Properties of a class that describe its state.
  
- **Methods**: Functions or operations that can be performed by the class.
  
- **Relationships**: Associations between classes (e.g., inheritance, association, aggregation).

#### Example Class Diagram:

| <<Class>> |
| ClassName |
| - attribute1: type |
| - attribute2: type |
| + method1(): return_type |
| + method2(param: type): void |


## Conclusion

The Low Level Design (LLD) phase is crucial for translating high-level system architecture into detailed implementation plans. It provides developers with a clear roadmap for building each component and ensures consistency and efficiency in software development.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Version Control**: Use Git or another version control system to manage changes and collaborate effectively.
  
- **Documentation**: Maintain thorough documentation alongside design artifacts to aid future maintenance and understanding.
  
- **Review Process**: Conduct design reviews to validate the design and identify potential improvements early in the development lifecycle.
